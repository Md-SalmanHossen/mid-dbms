### Question 1: Pet Grooming Salon Management System

#### a) ER Diagram Design

Based on the requirements for the pet grooming salon management system, here's how the ER diagram could be structured:

**Entities:**

1. **Customer**
    
    - Attributes: `customer_id (PK)`, `name`, `contact_info`, `email`, `address`
    - Relationships: A **Customer** owns multiple **Pets** and can have multiple **Appointments**.
2. **Pet**
    
    - Attributes: `pet_id (PK)`, `pet_name`, `species`, `breed`, `age`, `medical_conditions`, `grooming_preferences`, `customer_id (FK)`
    - Relationships: Each **Pet** is owned by a **Customer** (many-to-one). A **Pet** can have multiple **Appointments**.
3. **Groomer (Staff)**
    
    - Attributes: `groomer_id (PK)`, `name`, `contact_info`, `schedule`
    - Relationships: A **Groomer** can handle many **Appointments**.
4. **Appointment**
    
    - Attributes: `appointment_id (PK)`, `customer_id (FK)`, `pet_id (FK)`, `groomer_id (FK)`, `service_type`, `appointment_date`, `appointment_time`
    - Relationships: An **Appointment** involves one **Customer**, one **Pet**, and one **Groomer**. A **Customer** can book multiple **Appointments**.
5. **Service**
    
    - Attributes: `service_id (PK)`, `service_name`, `description`, `duration`, `cost`
    - Relationships: **Services** are performed on **Pets** during **Appointments**.

**Relationships:**

1. **Owns:** A **Customer** owns many **Pets** (one-to-many).
2. **Books:** A **Customer** can book many **Appointments** (one-to-many).
3. **Performed:** An **Appointment** can have multiple **Services** performed (many-to-many between **Appointment** and **Service**).
4. **Handled By:** An **Appointment** is handled by a **Groomer** (many-to-one).

#### b) Explanation of the Concept of Associative Entity Set

An **associative entity set** (also called a **junction entity set**) is used to represent a many-to-many relationship between two entities in a database. It is an entity that is used to bridge two other entities, where the relationship involves more than one attribute from each entity.

**Example:** In the pet grooming system, the relationship between **Pet** and **Service** is many-to-many because a **Pet** can have many services, and each **Service** can be applied to many **Pets**. An associative entity **Appointment_Services** can be used to represent this many-to-many relationship, where each entry in **Appointment_Services** links a **Pet**, a **Service**, and an **Appointment**.

### Question 2: Relational Schema and Database Concepts

#### a) Relational Schema for the Pet Grooming Salon System

Here’s the relational schema based on the ER diagram:

```sql
-- Customer Table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    address VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Pet Table
CREATE TABLE Pet (
    pet_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    pet_name VARCHAR(100),
    species VARCHAR(50),
    breed VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    medical_conditions TEXT,
    grooming_preferences TEXT,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id)
);

-- Groomer (Staff) Table
CREATE TABLE Groomer (
    groomer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255),
    schedule TEXT
);

-- Appointment Table
CREATE TABLE Appointment (
    appointment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    pet_id INT,
    groomer_id INT,
    service_type VARCHAR(100),
    appointment_date DATE,
    appointment_time TIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (pet_id) REFERENCES Pet(pet_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (groomer_id) REFERENCES Groomer(groomer_id)
);

-- Service Table
CREATE TABLE Service (
    service_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    service_name VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    duration INT,
    cost DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Appointment_Services Table (Associative Entity for many-to-many relationship)
CREATE TABLE Appointment_Services (
    appointment_id INT,
    service_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (appointment_id, service_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (appointment_id) REFERENCES Appointment(appointment_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (service_id) REFERENCES Service(service_id)
);
```

#### b) Components of a Database System and the Statement on DBMS and Integrity

**Components of a Database System:**

1. **Database Engine:** Responsible for storing, modifying, and retrieving data. It handles low-level data operations.
2. **Database Schema:** Describes the structure of the database including tables, relationships, and constraints.
3. **Query Processor:** Interprets and executes SQL queries, optimizing query performance and retrieving data efficiently.

**Statement on DBMS and Redundancy:**

I **agree** with the statement that "Database management systems help us to reduce redundancy and add integrity constraints for better management." Here’s why:

- **Reducing Redundancy:** DBMS helps in eliminating unnecessary duplication of data by enforcing normalization rules. For example, in the relational model, data can be stored in multiple related tables instead of repeating the same information across different parts of the system.
    
- **Adding Integrity Constraints:** A DBMS enforces integrity constraints such as **primary keys** (to avoid duplicate records), **foreign keys** (to ensure valid relationships between tables), **unique constraints** (to ensure data uniqueness), and **check constraints** (to maintain valid values). This ensures data consistency and prevents errors.
    

**Justification:**

- By reducing redundancy, a DBMS ensures that only essential and non-redundant data is stored, which minimizes storage costs and makes the data easier to maintain.
- By enforcing integrity constraints, a DBMS ensures that the data is accurate, reliable, and consistent, making it easier for applications to interact with the database and ensure correctness across various operations.
