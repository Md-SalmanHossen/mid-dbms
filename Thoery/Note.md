Understanding the terminology, keywords, and use cases of SQL is essential for effectively solving complex queries like the one above. Below is a structured lecture covering these concepts.

## **SQL Terminology and Keywords**

### **1. SELECT Statement**
The `SELECT` statement is the cornerstone of SQL, used to retrieve data from a database.

- **Terminology**:
  - **Columns**: Fields to retrieve.
  - **Tables**: Data sources.
  - **Predicates**: Conditions to filter rows.
  
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Retrieve specific columns: 
    ```sql
    SELECT name, salary FROM instructor;
    ```
  - Retrieve all columns:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM instructor;
    ```

---

### **2. WHERE Clause**
The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on conditions.

- **Terminology**:
  - **Predicate**: The condition to test (e.g., `salary > 50000`).
  
- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Filter by exact match:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM instructor WHERE dept_name = 'History';
    ```
  - Filter by range:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM student WHERE tot_cred BETWEEN 50 AND 100;
    ```

---

### **3. GROUP BY Clause**
The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows sharing a value, enabling aggregate operations.

- **Terminology**:
  - **Aggregate Function**: A function like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, or `MIN`.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column, aggregate_function(column)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Count students in each department:
    ```sql
    SELECT dept_name, COUNT(*) AS student_count
    FROM student
    GROUP BY dept_name;
    ```

---

### **4. HAVING Clause**
The `HAVING` clause filters groups created by `GROUP BY`.

- **Terminology**:
  - Used after `GROUP BY`, unlike `WHERE`, which filters rows before grouping.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column, aggregate_function(column)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column
  HAVING aggregate_function(column) condition;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Departments with more than 3 courses:
    ```sql
    SELECT dept_name, COUNT(course_id) AS course_count
    FROM course
    GROUP BY dept_name
    HAVING COUNT(course_id) > 3;
    ```

---

### **5. JOIN Clause**
The `JOIN` clause combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

- **Terminology**:
  - **Inner Join**: Only matching rows are included.
  - **Outer Join**: Includes unmatched rows (e.g., `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`).

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT columns
  FROM table1
  JOIN table2
  ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Combine instructors with their departments:
    ```sql
    SELECT instructor.name, department.dept_name
    FROM instructor
    JOIN department
    ON instructor.dept_name = department.dept_name;
    ```

---

### **6. Subqueries**
Subqueries are queries nested inside another query.

- **Terminology**:
  - **Nested Query**: A query inside `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE`.
  - **Correlated Subquery**: References columns from the outer query.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column
  FROM table
  WHERE column IN (SELECT column FROM another_table);
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Find instructors earning more than the average:
    ```sql
    SELECT name
    FROM instructor
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM instructor);
    ```

---

### **7. EXISTS Clause**
The `EXISTS` clause tests if a subquery returns any rows.

- **Terminology**:
  - Returns `TRUE` if the subquery has results, otherwise `FALSE`.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column
  FROM table
  WHERE EXISTS (subquery);
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - List students who have taken at least one course:
    ```sql
    SELECT name
    FROM student
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM takes WHERE student.ID = takes.ID);
    ```

---

### **8. NOT EXISTS Clause**
The `NOT EXISTS` clause checks if a subquery returns no rows.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column
  FROM table
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (subquery);
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Find students who havenâ€™t taken any course:
    ```sql
    SELECT name
    FROM student
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM takes WHERE student.ID = takes.ID);
    ```

---

### **9. ORDER BY Clause**
The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column
  FROM table
  ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Sort instructors by salary (descending):
    ```sql
    SELECT name, salary
    FROM instructor
    ORDER BY salary DESC;
    ```

---

### **10. LIMIT Clause**
The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column
  FROM table
  LIMIT number_of_rows;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - Top 5 highest-paid instructors:
    ```sql
    SELECT name, salary
    FROM instructor
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

---

### **11. DISTINCT Keyword**
The `DISTINCT` keyword eliminates duplicate rows.

- **Syntax**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT column
  FROM table;
  ```
  
- **Use Cases**:
  - List all unique department names:
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT dept_name
    FROM instructor;
    ```

---

### **12. Logical Operators**
- **AND**: Combines conditions that must all be true.
- **OR**: Combines conditions where at least one must be true.
- **NOT**: Negates a condition.

---

### **Use Cases Summary**
1. Use `WHERE` to filter rows based on conditions.  
2. Use `GROUP BY` for aggregation and `HAVING` to filter groups.  
3. Use `JOIN` to combine tables, ensuring relational integrity.  
4. Use subqueries for advanced filtering and comparisons.  
5. Use `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` to test the existence of rows.  
6. Use `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` for sorting and restricting results.
