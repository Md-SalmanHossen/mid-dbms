### Question 1: ER Diagram Design for "Elite" Event Organizer Company

#### a) ER Diagram Design

Based on the requirements, here’s how the ER diagram for the "Elite" event organizer company could look:

**Entities:**

1. **Event**
    
    - Attributes: `event_id (PK)`, `name`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `venue_id (FK)`, `description`, `supervisor_id (FK)`
    - Relationships: Each event has one **Venue** and one **Supervisor**. A supervisor manages multiple events.
2. **Venue**
    
    - Attributes: `venue_id (PK)`, `name`, `address`, `capacity`
    - Relationships: A venue can host multiple **Events**.
3. **Employee (Supervisor)**
    
    - Attributes: `employee_id (PK)`, `name`, `contact_info`, `previous_events`
    - Relationships: An employee can supervise many **Events**.
4. **Expense**
    
    - Attributes: `expense_id (PK)`, `event_id (FK)`, `service_expense`, `material_expense`
    - Relationships: Expenses are associated with a particular **Event**.
5. **Guest**
    
    - Attributes: `guest_id (PK)`, `name`, `contact_info`
    - Relationships: A guest can attend multiple **Events**.
6. **Attendance**
    
    - Attributes: `attendance_id (PK)`, `event_id (FK)`, `guest_id (FK)`, `attendance_status`
    - Relationships: Each **Guest** has an attendance record for **Events**.

**Relationships:**

- **Manages:** One **Supervisor** can manage many **Events** (1:N).
- **Held At:** An **Event** is held at a **Venue** (1:N).
- **Has Expenses:** An **Event** has **Expenses** (1:1).
- **Attends:** A **Guest** can attend many **Events** (M:N).

#### b) Difference Between DBMS and RDBMS

- **DBMS (Database Management System):**
    
    - A DBMS is a software system used to store and manage data. It provides basic functions for creating, managing, and querying databases.
    - Examples: File-based systems, Hierarchical DBMS, Network DBMS.
    - **Key Feature:** Does not impose a specific structure on the data.
- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):**
    
    - RDBMS is a type of DBMS that stores data in a tabular format (relations). It uses a set of predefined rules (such as normalization) to ensure data integrity and avoids redundancy.
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
    - **Key Feature:** Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are supported via foreign keys.

### Question 2: Schema for the ER Diagram

Here’s the SQL schema for the "Elite" Event Organizer System:

```sql
-- Venue Table
CREATE TABLE Venue (
    venue_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(255),
    capacity INT
);

-- Employee Table (Supervisors)
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255),
    previous_events TEXT
);

-- Event Table
CREATE TABLE Event (
    event_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    venue_id INT,
    description TEXT,
    supervisor_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (venue_id) REFERENCES Venue(venue_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (supervisor_id) REFERENCES Employee(employee_id)
);

-- Expense Table
CREATE TABLE Expense (
    expense_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id INT,
    service_expense DECIMAL(10, 2),
    material_expense DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES Event(event_id)
);

-- Guest Table
CREATE TABLE Guest (
    guest_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Attendance Table
CREATE TABLE Attendance (
    attendance_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id INT,
    guest_id INT,
    attendance_status VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES Event(event_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (guest_id) REFERENCES Guest(guest_id)
);
```

### Question 3: SQL Queries for Bookstore Database

#### a) SQL Queries for the Given Schema

```sql
-- i. Retrieve the titles of all books along with their corresponding authors' first and last names.
SELECT b.Title, a.FirstName, a.LastName
FROM Books b
JOIN Authors a ON b.AuthorID = a.AuthorID;

-- ii. Find the total amount spent by each customer, whose last name starts with “S”, in the year 2021. Include the customer's first and last names.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, SUM(od.Subtotal) AS TotalAmount
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
WHERE c.LastName LIKE 'S%' AND YEAR(o.Date) = 2021
GROUP BY c.CustomerID;

-- iii. Calculate the total sales generated from book sales in each genre. Display the genre names along with the total amount, sorted in descending order of revenue.
SELECT b.Genre, SUM(od.Subtotal) AS TotalSales
FROM Books b
JOIN OrderDetails od ON b.BookID = od.BookID
GROUP BY b.Genre
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

-- iv. Identify customers who have purchased books from more than one genre. Include the customer's first and last names, along with the number of genres they've purchased books from.
SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, COUNT(DISTINCT b.Genre) AS NumberOfGenres
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
JOIN Books b ON od.BookID = b.BookID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT b.Genre) > 1;
```

### Question 4: Table Creation and Modifications

#### a) SQL Queries to Create and Modify Tables

```sql
-- i. Create the tables for Publishers, Magazines, and Subscriptions
CREATE TABLE Publishers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    country VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Magazines (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    publisher_id INT,
    frequency VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (publisher_id) REFERENCES Publishers(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Subscriptions (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    magazine_id INT,
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (magazine_id) REFERENCES Magazines(id)
);

-- ii. Add the attribute 'website' to the Publishers table.
ALTER TABLE Publishers
ADD COLUMN website VARCHAR(255);

-- iii. Remove 'id' from the Publishers table and make 'name' the primary key.
ALTER TABLE Publishers
DROP COLUMN id;

ALTER TABLE Publishers
ADD PRIMARY KEY (name);
```

### Question 5: Relational Algebra Queries

#### i) Find All Information of Trips Between 1000 to 5000 tk on 29th February

```relational
σ(cost >= 1000 AND cost <= 5000 AND date = '2024-02-29') (Trips)
```

#### ii) Find the Names and Vehicle ID of Drivers Whose Vehicles Have Status “Unfit”

```relational
σ(status = 'Unfit') (Vehicles ⨝ Driver)
```

#### iii) Description of the Output for the Given Relational Algebra Expression

The given relational algebra query:

```relational
Π (t_id, date, route) (σ (cost > 3000 ^ route = (Π location(Passenger))) Trips)
```

**Explanation:**  
This query finds all trips where the cost is greater than 3000 and the route matches any of the locations of the **Passenger**. It returns the `t_id`, `date`, and `route` for these trips.

The query will return **all trips that cost more than 3000 tk where the route matches a passenger's location**.
