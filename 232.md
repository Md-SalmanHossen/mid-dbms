### Question 1: ER Diagram Design for SHEBA Rent A Car

#### a) ER Diagram Design

Here’s how the ER diagram would be structured based on the provided data:

**Entities:**

1. **Branch**
    
    - Attributes: `branch_id (PK)`, `branch_phone`, `address (road_no, area, city, zip_code)`
2. **Employee**
    
    - Attributes: `staff_id (PK)`, `name`, `title`, `date_of_hire`, `pay`, `experience`
    - Relationships: Assigned to one **Branch** (many employees per branch).
    - Role: One employee can be a **Manager** of a branch.
3. **Car**
    
    - Attributes: `car_id (PK)`, `brand_name`, `model_number`, `license_plate`, `category`, `daily_rental_cost`, `status`, `driver_name`
    - Relationships: A **Car** belongs to one **Branch** (many cars per branch).
4. **Customer**
    
    - Attributes: `customer_id (PK)`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `address`, `registration_date`, `branch_name`
    - Relationships: A **Customer** rents many **Cars**.
5. **Rental**
    
    - Attributes: `rental_id (PK)`, `renter_name`, `renter_phone`, `license_plate`, `rental_date_time`
    - Relationships: A **Rental** links a **Car** and a **Customer** (a customer can rent multiple cars over time).

**Relationships:**

1. **Works_For**: Employees work for a branch (one-to-many).
2. **Manages**: A manager is assigned to one branch (one-to-one).
3. **Owns**: A branch owns several cars (one-to-many).
4. **Rents**: A customer rents a car (many-to-many via the Rental relationship).

#### b) Explanation of Concurrency Control and Keys

**Concurrency Control:** Concurrency control refers to the mechanisms used by DBMS to ensure that database transactions are executed in a way that maintains data consistency, even when multiple transactions occur simultaneously. Common methods include locking, timestamp ordering, and optimistic concurrency control.

**Candidate Key vs Primary Key:**

- **Candidate Key:** A set of attributes that uniquely identifies each record in a table. There can be more than one candidate key in a table.
- **Primary Key:** A selected candidate key that uniquely identifies each record in a table. It cannot have NULL values and is chosen for its simplicity or relevance.

### Question 2: Schema and Relationship Types

#### a) Corresponding Schema for the ER Diagram

```sql
-- Branch Table
CREATE TABLE Branch (
    branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_phone VARCHAR(15),
    road_no VARCHAR(10),
    area VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    zip_code VARCHAR(10)
);

-- Employee Table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    staff_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    title VARCHAR(50),
    date_of_hire DATE,
    pay DECIMAL(10, 2),
    experience INT,
    branch_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES Branch(branch_id)
);

-- Car Table
CREATE TABLE Car (
    car_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    brand_name VARCHAR(50),
    model_number VARCHAR(50),
    license_plate VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    daily_rental_cost DECIMAL(10, 2),
    status VARCHAR(20),
    driver_name VARCHAR(100),
    branch_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES Branch(branch_id)
);

-- Customer Table
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    address VARCHAR(255),
    registration_date DATE,
    branch_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Rental Table
CREATE TABLE Rental (
    rental_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    renter_name VARCHAR(100),
    renter_phone VARCHAR(15),
    license_plate VARCHAR(20),
    rental_date_time DATETIME,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (license_plate) REFERENCES Car(license_plate)
);
```

#### b) Mapping Cardinalities and Relationship Sets

**Mapping Cardinalities:**

- **One-to-One (1:1):** A record in one table is related to one record in another table. Example: One **Manager** works at one **Branch**.
- **One-to-Many (1:N):** A record in one table is related to multiple records in another table. Example: One **Branch** has multiple **Employees** or **Cars**.
- **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Multiple records in one table can relate to multiple records in another table. Example: A **Customer** can rent multiple **Cars**, and each car can be rented by multiple customers over time (via the **Rental** relationship).

**Identifying vs Non-Identifying Relationships:**

- **Identifying Relationship:** A relationship where the child entity cannot exist without the parent entity. Example: A **Rental** cannot exist without a **Customer** and a **Car**.
- **Non-Identifying Relationship:** A relationship where the child entity can exist independently of the parent entity. Example: **Employee** can exist without being tied to a particular **Manager** (they are only managed by the manager).

### Question 3: SQL Queries

#### a) SQL Queries for Given Schema

```sql
-- i. Change the primary key of the orders table and declare order_id, customer_id and project_id together as a primary key.
ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP PRIMARY KEY,
ADD PRIMARY KEY (order_id, customer_id, project_id);

-- ii. Find out the project names where the duration of the project is not more than a year.
SELECT name
FROM Projects
WHERE DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date) <= 365;

-- iii. Find out the Employee names of those employees who aged less than the average age of all employees for each department.
SELECT e.name
FROM Employees e
JOIN (SELECT department_id, AVG(age) AS avg_age
      FROM Employees
      GROUP BY department_id) avg_dept
ON e.department_id = avg_dept.department_id
WHERE e.age < avg_dept.avg_age;

-- iv. Find out the name and address of each customer who has placed a project order and the project name is not starting with any vowel or not ending with “ea”.
SELECT c.name, c.address
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN Projects p ON o.project_id = p.project_id
WHERE (p.name NOT LIKE 'A%' AND p.name NOT LIKE 'E%' AND p.name NOT LIKE 'I%' AND p.name NOT LIKE 'O%' AND p.name NOT LIKE 'U%')
AND p.name NOT LIKE '%ea';

-- v. Find out the Employee name and assignment id of the 2nd first employee based on the number of assignments provided for that employee.
SELECT e.name, a.assignment_id
FROM Employees e
JOIN Assignments a ON e.employee_id = a.employee_id
GROUP BY e.name
ORDER BY COUNT(a.assignment_id) DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```

### Question 4: Relational Algebra Queries

#### i) Post Contents Without Any Comment

```relational
π(content, user_id) (Post) - π(content, user_id) (Post ⨝ Comment)
```

#### ii) Details About Female Users with ID Between 2 and 15

```relational
σ(gender='F' AND user_id BETWEEN 2 AND 15) (User)
```

#### iii) Details of Users with Friends and More Than 5 Posts

```relational
σ(status IS NOT NULL) (Friend) ⨝ σ(COUNT(Post.post_id) > 5) (Post)
```

These queries cover your exam requirements for relational algebra and SQL. Let me know if you need further clarification on any point!
