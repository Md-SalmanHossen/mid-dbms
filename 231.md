### 1. **SQL Queries**

**Question:** Write an SQL query to find the second-highest salary from the `employees` table.

**Solution:**

#### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
```

#### Explanation:

- The subquery `(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees)` finds the highest salary.
- The outer query selects the maximum salary that is strictly less than the highest salary, which will be the second-highest salary.
- This works under the assumption that there is no tie for the highest salary (if there are ties, this query will still return the second-highest unique salary).

### 2. **Relational Algebra**

**Question:** Given two relations `Employee(EmpID, Name, Salary)` and `Department(DeptID, DeptName, EmpID)`, write a relational algebra expression to find the names of employees who work in the 'IT' department.

**Solution:**

#### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Selection (σ)**: Select the rows where `DeptName = 'IT'` from the `Department` relation.
    
    σDeptName=′IT′(Department)\sigma_{DeptName='IT'}(Department)
    
    This results in a relation where only employees from the 'IT' department are retained.
    
2. **Join (⨝)**: Perform a natural join between `Employee` and the result of the previous selection based on the common attribute `EmpID`.
    
    Employee⋈Employee.EmpID=Department.EmpIDσDeptName=′IT′(Department)Employee \bowtie_{Employee.EmpID = Department.EmpID} \sigma_{DeptName='IT'}(Department)
    
    This will merge the `Employee` relation with the filtered `Department` relation to get all employees working in the 'IT' department.
    
3. **Projection (π)**: Project only the `Name` column to get the names of employees.
    
    πName(Employee⋈Employee.EmpID=Department.EmpIDσDeptName=′IT′(Department))\pi_{Name}(Employee \bowtie_{Employee.EmpID = Department.EmpID} \sigma_{DeptName='IT'}(Department))

#### Final Expression:

πName(Employee⋈Employee.EmpID=Department.EmpIDσDeptName=′IT′(Department))\pi_{Name}(Employee \bowtie_{Employee.EmpID = Department.EmpID} \sigma_{DeptName='IT'}(Department))

### 3. **ER Model (Entity-Relationship Model)**

**Question:** Design an ER diagram for a university database that includes students, courses, and enrollments. A student can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students.

#### Solution:

1. **Entities**:
    - `Student`: Attributes include `StudentID`, `Name`, `DOB` (Date of Birth), etc.
    - `Course`: Attributes include `CourseID`, `CourseName`, `Credits`, etc.
2. **Relationships**:
    - `Enrolls`: A many-to-many relationship between `Student` and `Course`, where a student can enroll in many courses, and a course can have many students.
3. **Attributes of the Relationship**:
    - `Enrolls` may include attributes like `EnrollmentDate`, `Grade`, etc.
4. **Diagram Structure**:
    - Draw a rectangle for `Student`, another for `Course`.
    - Draw a diamond for the `Enrolls` relationship between `Student` and `Course`.
    - The `Enrolls` relationship will have attributes like `Grade` and `EnrollmentDate` connected to it.

#### ER Diagram:

```
    [Student]  ---<Enrolls>---  [Course]
         |                        |
     (StudentID, Name, DOB)   (CourseID, CourseName, Credits)
         |
   (EnrollmentDate, Grade)
```

### 4. **Normalization**

**Question:** Given a table `Employee(EmployeeID, Name, Department, DepartmentHead)` with the following data:

|EmployeeID|Name|Department|DepartmentHead|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|John|HR|Alice|
|2|Mike|IT|Bob|
|3|Sarah|HR|Alice|

Normalize this table to 3NF.

#### Solution:

1. **1NF (First Normal Form)**: The table already satisfies 1NF, as it has atomic values (no repeating groups).
    
2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: To remove partial dependencies:
    
    - `DepartmentHead` depends only on `Department`, not on `EmployeeID`.
    - Split the table into two:
        - `Employee(EmployeeID, Name, Department)`
        - `Department(Department, DepartmentHead)`
3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: There are no transitive dependencies, as `DepartmentHead` now only depends on `Department`. The tables are in 3NF.
    

#### Final Tables after Normalization:

- **Employee**:
    
    |EmployeeID|Name|Department|
    |---|---|---|
    |1|John|HR|
    |2|Mike|IT|
    |3|Sarah|HR|
    
- **Department**:
    
    |Department|DepartmentHead|
    |---|---|
    |HR|Alice|
    |IT|Bob|

### 5. **Data Structures & Algorithms**

**Question:** Write an algorithm to perform a binary search on a sorted array.

#### Solution:

#### Binary Search Algorithm (in Python):

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid  # Target found at index `mid`
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1  # Search the right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1  # Search the left half
    
    return -1  # Target not found
```

#### Explanation:

- **Binary Search** works on a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the array in half by comparing the target with the middle element:
    - If the target is equal to the middle element, return the index.
    - If the target is less than the middle element, search the left half.
    - If the target is greater, search the right half.
- The time complexity of binary search is **O(log n)**.

### 6. **Operating Systems**

**Question:** Explain the difference between a process and a thread.

#### Solution:

- **Process**: A process is an independent program that is executing. It has its own memory space, resources, and system state. Processes do not share their memory with other processes unless specifically designed to communicate via inter-process communication (IPC).
    
- **Thread**: A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share the same memory space and resources. Threads are lighter-weight than processes and are used for tasks that can run concurrently within the same program. Threads within a process can communicate with each other more easily than processes.
    

#### Key Differences:

- Processes have separate memory spaces, while threads share memory within the same process.
- Threads are more efficient for tasks requiring high concurrency because they share resources, whereas processes need more resources due to their isolation.

### 7. **Computer Networks**

**Question:** What is the difference between TCP and UDP?

#### Solution:

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
    
    - Connection-oriented.
    - Reliable: Guarantees data delivery, order, and integrity through acknowledgments.
    - Slower than UDP due to overhead from error checking and retransmissions.
    - Example: HTTP, FTP, and HTTPS.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
    
    - Connectionless.
    - Unreliable: No guarantee of delivery or order.
    - Faster than TCP because it has less overhead.
    - Example: DNS, VoIP, and streaming.
