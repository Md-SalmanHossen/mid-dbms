### Question 1: ER Diagram Design for Gym Membership System

#### a) ER Diagram Design

For the Gym Membership System, here’s a possible ER diagram:

**Entities:**

1. **User**
    
    - Attributes: `user_id (PK)`, `name`, `contact_info`, `username (unique)`, `password`
    - Relationships: Can have a **Membership**, can schedule **Training Sessions**, can check-in for **Attendance**.
2. **Membership Plan**
    
    - Attributes: `plan_id (PK)`, `plan_type`, `price`, `duration`, `features`
    - Relationships: Can have many **Members** (Users), Users can enroll in one **Membership Plan**.
3. **Trainer**
    
    - Attributes: `trainer_id (PK)`, `name`, `contact_info`, `specialization`
    - Relationships: Can schedule **Training Sessions** with **Members**.
4. **Training Session**
    
    - Attributes: `session_id (PK)`, `trainer_id (FK)`, `member_id (FK)`, `date_time`
    - Relationships: A **Trainer** schedules a **Training Session** for a **Member**.
5. **Attendance**
    
    - Attributes: `attendance_id (PK)`, `member_id (FK)`, `check_in_time`, `check_out_time`
    - Relationships: Tracks **Member Attendance** for gym entry and exit.

**Relationships:**

- **Enrolled In**: Many **Users** can enroll in a **Membership Plan** (many-to-one).
- **Schedules**: **Trainer** schedules a **Training Session** with a **User** (many-to-many).
- **Records**: **Attendance** is recorded for each **User** (one-to-many).

#### b) Explanation of the Query Processor and Identifying Relationship

**Query Processor in DBMS:** A query processor in a database management system is responsible for translating and executing queries. It generally consists of:

1. **Parser:** It checks the syntax of the SQL query.
2. **Optimizer:** It determines the most efficient way to execute a query.
3. **Execution Engine:** It executes the query and retrieves the results.

**Identifying Relationship:** An identifying relationship is a strong relationship, where the child entity cannot exist without the parent entity, and the child’s primary key includes the primary key of the parent entity. For example, **Training Session** depends on both the **Trainer** and **User**, and cannot exist without these two entities. Hence, it is a strong (identifying) relationship.

### Question 2: Schema Design and Relationship Types

#### a) Corresponding Schema for the ER Diagram

```sql
-- User Table
CREATE TABLE User (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255),
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Membership Plan Table
CREATE TABLE Membership_Plan (
    plan_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    plan_type VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    duration VARCHAR(20),
    features TEXT
);

-- Trainer Table
CREATE TABLE Trainer (
    trainer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    contact_info VARCHAR(255),
    specialization VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Training Session Table
CREATE TABLE Training_Session (
    session_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    trainer_id INT,
    member_id INT,
    date_time DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (trainer_id) REFERENCES Trainer(trainer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES User(user_id)
);

-- Attendance Table
CREATE TABLE Attendance (
    attendance_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id INT,
    check_in_time DATETIME,
    check_out_time DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES User(user_id)
);

-- Membership Enrollment Table
CREATE TABLE Membership_Enrollment (
    user_id INT,
    plan_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, plan_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES User(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (plan_id) REFERENCES Membership_Plan(plan_id)
);
```

#### b) Types of Mapping Cardinalities

**Mapping Cardinalities:**

1. **One-to-One (1:1)**: One record in the first table relates to one record in the second table.
    
    - Example: A **User** can have only one **Membership Plan**.
2. **One-to-Many (1:N)**: One record in the first table relates to multiple records in the second table.
    
    - Example: One **Trainer** can schedule multiple **Training Sessions**.
3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Multiple records in the first table relate to multiple records in the second table.
    
    - Example: A **User** can schedule multiple **Training Sessions** with different **Trainers**.

**Identifying vs Non-Identifying Relationships:**

- **Identifying Relationship**: The primary key of the child entity includes the primary key of the parent entity. Example: **Training Session** has an identifying relationship with both **Trainer** and **User** because the session cannot exist without both.
- **Non-Identifying Relationship**: The primary key of the child entity does not include the primary key of the parent entity. Example: **User** enrolling in **Membership Plan** is a non-identifying relationship because users can exist without being enrolled in a plan.

### Question 3: SQL Queries

#### a) SQL Queries for Given Schema

```sql
-- i. Retrieve the names of all cricket teams in the database.
SELECT TeamName FROM Teams;

-- ii. Retrieve the first names and last names of all players who have participated in matches against "Team England."
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, m.Result, 
       CASE 
           WHEN m.WinningTeam = 'England' THEN (SELECT TeamName FROM Teams WHERE TeamID = m.LosingTeam)
           ELSE (SELECT TeamName FROM Teams WHERE TeamID = m.WinningTeam)
       END AS OpposingTeam
FROM Players p
JOIN Matches m ON p.TeamID IN (m.WinningTeam, m.LosingTeam)
WHERE (m.WinningTeam = (SELECT TeamID FROM Teams WHERE TeamName = 'England') OR
       m.LosingTeam = (SELECT TeamID FROM Teams WHERE TeamName = 'England'));

-- iii. Find the total runs scored by each player in a match, along with their names, in which they scored more than 50 runs. Sort the results in descending order of runs.
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, SUM(pp.RunsScored) AS TotalRuns
FROM PlayerPerformance pp
JOIN Players p ON pp.PlayerID = p.PlayerID
WHERE pp.RunsScored > 50
GROUP BY p.PlayerID
ORDER BY TotalRuns DESC;

-- iv. Find the date, venue, and result of matches in which players from "Team Australia" took more than 5 wickets. For each match, list the player's name who achieved this and the number of wickets they took.
SELECT m.Date, m.Venue, m.Result, p.FirstName, p.LastName, pp.WicketsTaken
FROM Matches m
JOIN PlayerPerformance pp ON m.MatchID = pp.MatchID
JOIN Players p ON pp.PlayerID = p.PlayerID
WHERE pp.WicketsTaken > 5
AND p.TeamID = (SELECT TeamID FROM Teams WHERE TeamName = 'Australia');
```

#### b) Table Creation and Modifications

```sql
-- i. Create tables as described.
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    phone_number VARCHAR(15)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    category VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cust_id INT,
    cart_id INT,
    date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (cust_id) REFERENCES Customers(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Carts (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(id)
);

-- ii. Add attribute 'address' to Customers table.
ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(255);

-- iii. Remove 'id' from Customers and make 'email' the primary key.
ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN id;

ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD PRIMARY KEY (email);
```

### Question 4: Relational Algebra Queries

#### i) Get the Details About All “Parts” Available in “Dhaka” Area

```relational
σ(area='Dhaka') (Suppliers ⨝ Catalog ⨝ Parts)
```

#### ii) Find the “Suppliers” Selling “Green” Coloured “Wool” Parts and Have More Than 500 Units in Stock

```relational
σ(pname='Wool' AND color='Green' AND amount > 500) (Suppliers ⨝ Catalog ⨝ Parts)
```

#### iii) Find the Output for the Given Relational Algebra Expression

The given relational algebra query:

```relational
Π (amount, cost) (σ (pid = (Π pid (σ (color = ‘red’)Parts)) ) Catalog)
```

**Explanation:** This query finds the amount and cost of all parts that are red in color. It first finds the `pid` of red parts and then retrieves the corresponding `amount` and `cost` for those parts in the `Catalog` table.
