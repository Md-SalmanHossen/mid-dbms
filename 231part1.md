### Question 1: ER Diagram Design for UIU CSE Alumni Association Job Portal

#### a) ER Diagram Design

The scenario describes a complex relationship involving users (job seekers), recruiters, companies, and job posts. Here's a structured approach to design the ER diagram:

- **Entities:**
    
    1. **Job Seeker**
        
        - Attributes: `user_id (PK)`, `name`, `email (unique)`, `address`, `dob (date of birth)`, `educational_qualifications`, `job_experiences`
        - Relationships: Can be hired by a recruiter or company, can show interest in job posts.
    2. **Recruiter**
        
        - Attributes: `recruiter_id (PK)`, `name`, `email (unique)`, `reputation_score`
        - Relationships: Can post job openings, can hire job seekers.
    3. **Company**
        
        - Attributes: `company_id (PK)`, `name`, `address`, `contact_number`
        - Relationships: Can post job openings, can hire job seekers, can receive reviews.
    4. **Job Post**
        
        - Attributes: `post_id (PK)`, `post_date`, `post_time`, `content`, `number_of_viewers`
        - Relationships: Posted by either recruiter or company, can be viewed by job seekers, can be applied for.
    5. **Educational Qualification**
        
        - Attributes: `degree_name`, `institution_name`, `achieved_year`, `grade`
        - Relationships: Part of job seeker's profile.
    6. **Job Experience**
        
        - Attributes: `job_title`, `institution_name`, `job_type`, `start_date`, `duration`
        - Relationships: Part of job seeker's profile.
    7. **Review**
        
        - Attributes: `review_id (PK)`, `review_date`, `review_time`, `review_details`
        - Relationships: Given by job seekers about companies.
- **Relationships:**
    
    1. **Interest in Job Post:** Many-to-many between Job Seekers and Job Posts (one job seeker can be interested in many posts, and one post can have many job seekers).
    2. **Hiring Relationship:** Many-to-many between Recruiters/Companies and Job Seekers (a recruiter/company can hire multiple job seekers).
    3. **Job Seeker - Educational Qualifications:** One-to-many relationship (a job seeker can have multiple educational qualifications).
    4. **Job Seeker - Job Experience:** One-to-many relationship (a job seeker can have multiple job experiences).
    5. **Reviewing Companies:** Many-to-one relationship (many job seekers can review one company).

#### b) Schema for the ER Diagram

The schema that corresponds to the ER diagram can be written as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Job_Seeker (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    address VARCHAR(255),
    dob DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Educational_Qualification (
    edu_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    degree_name VARCHAR(100),
    institution_name VARCHAR(100),
    achieved_year INT,
    grade VARCHAR(10),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Job_Seeker(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Job_Experience (
    job_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    job_title VARCHAR(100),
    institution_name VARCHAR(100),
    job_type VARCHAR(50),
    start_date DATE,
    duration INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Job_Seeker(user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Recruiter (
    recruiter_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    reputation_score INT
);

CREATE TABLE Company (
    company_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(255),
    contact_number VARCHAR(15)
);

CREATE TABLE Job_Post (
    post_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    post_date DATE,
    post_time TIME,
    content TEXT,
    number_of_viewers INT,
    poster_type VARCHAR(10),  -- Can be 'recruiter' or 'company'
    poster_id INT,            -- Refers to recruiter or company
    FOREIGN KEY (poster_id) REFERENCES Recruiter(recruiter_id) 
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Job_Seeker_Interest (
    user_id INT,
    post_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, post_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Job_Seeker(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (post_id) REFERENCES Job_Post(post_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Review (
    review_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    company_id INT,
    review_date DATE,
    review_time TIME,
    review_details TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Job_Seeker(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES Company(company_id)
);
```

### Question 1: Additional Concepts

#### c) Conceptual Questions

i. **What is mapping cardinality?**

Mapping cardinality refers to the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with instances of another entity in a relationship. Cardinality helps define the nature of the relationship between entities.

ii. **What are the possible mapping cardinalities for a binary relationship set?**

The four main types of mapping cardinalities for binary relationships are:

1. **One-to-One (1:1):** Each instance in Entity A is associated with at most one instance in Entity B and vice versa.
2. **One-to-Many (1:N):** One instance in Entity A is associated with many instances in Entity B, but each instance in Entity B is associated with at most one instance in Entity A.
3. **Many-to-One (N:1):** Many instances in Entity A are associated with one instance in Entity B.
4. **Many-to-Many (M:N):** Many instances in Entity A are associated with many instances in Entity B.

iii. **What are the problems with many-to-many relationships?**

Many-to-many relationships can lead to issues like:

- **Data Redundancy:** Information may be repeated in the database.
- **Complexity in Queries:** Writing queries becomes difficult and inefficient.
- **Maintenance Problems:** Inserting, deleting, or updating records in a many-to-many relationship requires careful handling to avoid data anomalies.

iv. **How do you resolve a many-to-many relationship in the database?**

To resolve a many-to-many relationship, you introduce an intermediate (junction) table that links the two entities together. This table typically contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the two related entities.

### Question 2: SQL and Relational Algebra

#### a) SQL Queries

```sql
-- i. Find player name and team name for all the players above 25.
SELECT p.name AS player_name, t.name AS team_name
FROM Player p
JOIN Team t ON p.team_id = t.id
WHERE p.age > 25;

-- ii. Find the player name who has won the maximum number of POTM awards.
SELECT p.name
FROM Player p
JOIN Match m ON p.id = m.POTM
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY COUNT(m.POTM) DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- iii. Find the name and average rating of players of the top 5 teams in respect of trophy count.
SELECT p.name, AVG(md.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM Player p
JOIN Match_details md ON p.id = md.p_id
JOIN Team t ON p.team_id = t.id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY t.trophy_count DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- iv. Find coach name and total goals scored in the last 10 home matches of his team.
SELECT c.name AS coach_name, SUM(md.goal) AS total_goals
FROM Coach c
JOIN Team t ON c.t_id = t.id
JOIN Match m ON m.home_team = t.id
JOIN Match_details md ON m.id = md.m_id
WHERE c.name LIKE '%dan' AND LENGTH(c.name) >= 5
ORDER BY m.day DESC, m.month DESC, m.year DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### b) Relational Algebra Queries

```relational
-- i. Get the details about all flights from Dhaka to Cox's Bazar.
σ(src='Dhaka' AND dest='Cox’s Bazar') (Flight)

-- ii. Find the passenger names for passengers who have bookings on at least one flight.
π(pname) (Passenger ⨝ Booking ⨝ Flight)

-- iii. Find the passenger names for those who do not have any bookings in any flights.
π(pname) (Passenger) - π(pname) (Passenger ⨝ Booking)

-- iv. Find the details of all male passengers who are associated with ShareTrip agency.
σ(pgender='M' AND aname='ShareTrip') (Passenger ⨝ Booking ⨝ Agency)
```

#### c) SQL Script to Create Database

```sql
CREATE TABLE Passenger (
    pid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    pname VARCHAR(100),
    pgender CHAR(1),
    pcity VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Agency (
    aid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    aname VARCHAR(100),
    acity VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Flight (
    fid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    fdate DATE,
    time TIME,
    src VARCHAR(100),
    dest VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Booking (
    pid INT,
    aid INT,
    fid INT,
    fdate DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (pid, aid, fid),
    FOREIGN KEY (pid) REFERENCES Passenger(pid),
    FOREIGN KEY (aid) REFERENCES Agency(aid),
    FOREIGN KEY (fid) REFERENCES Flight(fid)
);
```

#### d) Reasons for Null Values in a Database

1. **Missing Information:** Data might not be

available at the time of entry. For example, if a customer's phone number is not provided, the phone number field might contain a null value.

2. **Irrelevant Information:** Sometimes, certain attributes do not apply to all records. For instance, a student's `graduation_date` might be null if the student hasn't graduated yet.
