### Question 1: Relational Algebra Expressions

#### i) Find all the bids that started at a price greater than 3000 and finally sold at less than 15,000.

We need to select the bids where the `StartBid` is greater than 3000 and the `FinalSellingPrice` is less than 15,000.

Relational Algebra Expression:

```relational
σ(StartBid > 3000 ∧ FinalSellingPrice < 15000) (Bid)
```

#### ii) Find the patent no. and patent titles for all the users who sold their patents at a price greater than 2000.

We need to join the `Bid` table with the `Patent` table, and filter the results for those where the `FinalSellingPrice` is greater than 2000.

Relational Algebra Expression:

```relational
π(PatentNo, PatentTitle) (σ(FinalSellingPrice > 2000) (Patent ⨝ Bid))
```

#### iii) Find the output for the following:

```relational
Π(PatentNo, PatentContents) (σ(StartBid > 3000 ^ PatentNo = (Π PatentNo (Patent))) Bid)
```

**Explanation:**  
This query will return the **PatentNo** and **PatentContents** for all the patents that had a **StartBid** greater than 3000. The condition `PatentNo = (Π PatentNo(Patent))` ensures that we are considering only patents from the `Patent` table that are also present in the `Bid` table.

**Output:**  
This query will return the **PatentNo** and **PatentContents** for all the patents whose **StartBid** was greater than 3000 and that appear in the **Bid** table.

**Example:** "All patents whose initial bid price was greater than 3000."

### Question 2: SQL Queries for the Music Billboard Database

#### a) SQL Queries for the Given Schema

**i) Retrieve all artists' names and their genres.**

```sql
SELECT Name, Genre
FROM Artist;
```

**ii) Retrieve the list of songs along with their album titles.**

```sql
SELECT s.Title AS SongTitle, a.Title AS AlbumTitle
FROM Song s
JOIN Album a ON s.AlbumID = a.AlbumID;
```

**iii) Retrieve the list of artists and their albums, including artists who don't have any albums.**

To include artists who do not have any albums, we need to use a `LEFT JOIN` to ensure artists without albums are also included.

```sql
SELECT ar.Name AS ArtistName, al.Title AS AlbumTitle
FROM Artist ar
LEFT JOIN Album al ON ar.ArtistID = al.ArtistID;
```

**iv) List the names of artists who have songs that have charted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.**

Assuming "Billboard Hot 100" is represented as one of the `ChartName` values in the `BillboardChart` table, we need to find the artists whose songs appear on that chart.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ar.Name
FROM Artist ar
JOIN Album al ON ar.ArtistID = al.ArtistID
JOIN Song s ON al.AlbumID = s.AlbumID
JOIN ChartEntry ce ON s.SongID = ce.SongID
JOIN BillboardChart bc ON ce.ChartID = bc.ChartID
WHERE bc.ChartName = 'Billboard Hot 100';
```

**v) Using subquery, find the album with the highest total duration of songs.**

We can use a subquery to calculate the total duration for each album and then select the album with the maximum total duration.

```sql
SELECT Title
FROM Album
WHERE AlbumID = (
    SELECT AlbumID
    FROM Song
    GROUP BY AlbumID
    ORDER BY SUM(Duration) DESC
    LIMIT 1
);
```

#### b) Fixing the SQL Script for the Music Billboard Project

The SQL script provided is:

```sql
WITH AvgArtistID AS (
    SELECT AVG(ArtistID) AS AvgID
    FROM Song
)
SELECT Title, Genre, AVG(Duration)
FROM Song, AvgArtistID
WHERE AVG(Duration) > Duration
GROUP BY Genre
HAVING Genre = 'Pop';
SELECT * FROM AvgArtistID;
```

**Issues with the original query:**

1. The `AVG()` function cannot be used directly in the `WHERE` clause because `AVG(Duration)` is an aggregate function that operates over a group, not a single value.
2. The `AVG(Duration)` in the `SELECT` clause is used without grouping by the correct fields.
3. The `AVG(Duration)` is calculated incorrectly in relation to the individual `Duration` values in the `WHERE` clause.

**Fixed SQL Query:**

We need to:

- Remove the erroneous `WHERE AVG(Duration) > Duration`.
- Correctly calculate the average duration by grouping.
- Use the `HAVING` clause correctly for filtering the genre.

Here’s the corrected version:

```sql
WITH AvgArtistID AS (
    SELECT AVG(ArtistID) AS AvgID
    FROM Song
)
SELECT s.Title, a.Genre, AVG(s.Duration) AS AvgDuration
FROM Song s
JOIN Album a ON s.AlbumID = a.AlbumID
WHERE a.Genre = 'Pop'
GROUP BY a.Genre, s.Title
HAVING AVG(s.Duration) > 0; -- You can adjust this condition as per your need, this is just a placeholder
```

**Explanation of Fixes:**

1. **AVG(Duration)** is now calculated for each **Song** grouped by **Album** and **Genre**.
2. The `HAVING` clause is used correctly after the `GROUP BY` to filter by the **Pop** genre.
3. The `WITH AvgArtistID` part is kept for any further use of the average artist ID if needed later.
